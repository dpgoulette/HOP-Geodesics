HOP-Geodesics
=============
This is code is functional currently but it is not complete and is under active development (Feb 18th, 2015)
The code in this repository is the MATLAB code explained in the parent directory dpgoulette/HOP-Geodesics.
 
This code requires raw 2d or 3d data spatial data.  Two sample data sets are included in this directory: "3D_example.txt" and "FlatDataExample.txt."  You need to download all of the files in this repository and save them in a single directory (or in a directory that is in your MATLAB path).  Open the HOP_Geodesics_main.m file and read the comments on how to run that script.  HOP_Geodesics_main.m will run the current model in an interactive session at the MATLAB terminal 
 
This code requires a version of MATLAB that has the TriRep class.  Specifically, you need the DelaunayTri subclass.  This is needed to create the Delaunay triangulation of the data as well as the Voronoi cells.
