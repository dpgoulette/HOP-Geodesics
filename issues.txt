Planned:  
    - Create a tutorial version to explain our paper and research.  
          This version will go through each step in the process and plot
          everything step-by-step with explanations. Cover, delaunay,
          voronoi, hop, maxclasses, and alpha complexes.

    - Split the main code into an interactive version that the user can
          play around with.  A second version will be for batch
          simulation.  The second version should be a function that takes
          parameters that set all of the different options.

 
Issues:

- research methods on removing find, ismember, and intersect functions.  These are the bottlnecks in a few places.  They are pretty inefficient.  Rerun the profiler.

-hopmaxconnect.  Possibly some efficiency improvements are possible.  Avoid ismember calls where possible (might not be possible).  Also the code does some deleting of array rows that may not be needed and actually might slow things.  

- GeoTris still finds false triangles.  (This is likely true for geo tetras as well.)  This doesn't currently effect the results, but it is counterintuitive and the current plots show overlapping triangles (because of the low alpha value of the triangles - you can see the overlap).


    - fix comments for reruning with last_run_data struct. (here and
    HOPDataPrepare).

    - AlphaOneCells3d and AlphaOneCells2d need comments and cleanup.

    - hopmaxconnect still uses
    maxconnect internally.  It works but the code is not as simple and efficient 
    as it could be.  We possibly want to redo it to use only maxclass.

    - GeoTris still creates a Geodesic_Tris cell that
    we are no longer using.  (GeoTris is not returning this cell
    currently.)  Consider removing this from the script.  Do everything
    with the maxclass struct.

    - GeoTetras still creates a cell for the tetras.  Same issue as the
    previous issue.

    - Need comments and cleanup throughout
          hopmaxconnect
          GeodesicPlot (and dependencies)

    - Fix the inner for loop in HOPStructCreate.  Too many hidden
    breakpoints. Should be a while loop.  Easier to read.

    - HOPClasses still finds the boundary and interior edges but this is
    still not well defined.  Consider revisiting and clarifying.
