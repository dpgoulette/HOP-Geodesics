Planned:  
    - Create a tutorial version to explain our paper and research.  
          This version will go through each step in the process and plot
          everything step-by-step with explanations. Cover, delaunay,
          voronoi, hop, maxclasses, and alpha complexes.

    - Split the main code into an interactive version that the user can
          play around with.  A second version will be for batch
          simulation.  The second version should be a function that takes
          parameters that set all of the different options.

 
Issues:


    - Fix struct preallocation: hop, maxclass, minclass (where needed).

    - Related to last issue: fix the assignment to the fields in
    HOPClasses.  Unneeded preallocation (preassignment to a fields in not
    needed if the array of structs is already initialized).

    - fix comments for reruning with last_run_data struct. (here and
    HOPDataPrepare).

    - AlphaOneCells3d and AlphaOneCells2d need comments and cleanup.

    - restructure the main and dependencies for clarity.  Push the user
    questions into the functions where possible.  Have the main only save
    the main data needed for data analysis.

    - hopmaxconnect still uses
    maxconnect internally.  It works but the code is not as simple as it
    could be.  We possibly want to redo it to use only maxclass.

    - GeoTris still creates a Geodesic_Tris cell that
    we are no longer using.  (GeoTris is not returning this cell
    currently.)  Consider removing this from the script.  Do everything
    with the maxclass struct.

    - GeoTetras still creates a cell for the tetras.  Same issue as the
    previous issue.

    - Need comments and cleanup throughout
          hopmaxconnect
          GeodesicPlot (and dependencies)

    - Fix the inner for loop in HOPStructCreate.  Too many hidden
    breakpoints. Should be a while loop.  Easier to read.

    - HOPClasses still finds the boundary and interior edges but this is
    still not well defined.  Consider revisiting and clarifying.
